This is a project, create while doing the Javascript bootcamp at Barcelona Code School.
This webpage is meant to be used as a platform to find the different sport locations that Barcelona goverment has provided. These facilities are usually for free, and a great way to spend time with your friends or family while being active and outside. The lack of information that is availble made me want to create a new free space where  the  information is easy to get.
More categories will be added and the features will be updated.
Mobileapp will also be adapted.
